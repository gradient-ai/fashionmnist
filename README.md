# Fashion MNIST Keras Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will create a Gradient [Workflow](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/v/gradient-next/explore-train-deploy/workflows) to train a Keras model based on the Fashion MNIST dataset. We will then save that model (exported in the TensorFlow format) to the Gradient [model repository](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/v/gradient-next/data/models). Once the model is saved, it is ready to deploy as an [API endpoint](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/v/gradient-next/explore-train-deploy/deployments). By running infer.py in the infer directory, we can use the API endpoint to make predictions.

## End-to-end tutorial
You can start by learning how to train the model [here](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/v/gradient-next/get-started/tutorials-list/registering-models-in-gradient).

After training is complete, you can follow [this](https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/v/gradient-next/get-started/tutorials-list/dealing-with-gradient-deployments) guide to deploy the model.
